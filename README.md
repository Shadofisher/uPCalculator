# uPCalculator
This project aims to develop an opensource scientific calculator using the STM32F746Discovery board as the prototype platform. It will be powered by Micropython (on the STM side) and Sympy. A raspberry pi zero will be connected to the Discovery board and will act as the sympy/numpy co-processor
